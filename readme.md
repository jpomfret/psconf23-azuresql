# PSConfEU 2023 - Building Azure Infrastructure with PowerShell Azure Functions called from inside a Azure SQL DB

## Description

Azure SQL DB now has the ability to call REST endpoints from within the database, this means you can integrate your database code with data from the outside world - anything that can be retrieved from a REST endpoint.

It also means you can call Azure PowerShell Functions to do work for you based on data within your database.

In this session we'll build a database that not only keeps track of our Azure infrastructure - but actually builds it out for us. Imagine if adding a row to a table could kick off a process to actually deploy those Azure resources.
